Kane the instrument of vengeance in one-sided rant against Dortmund | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/nov/06/kane-the-instrument-of-vengeance-in-one-sided-rant-against-dortmund,"<p>Things aren’t perfect at Bayern but record-threatening striker’s Klassiker hat-trick suggests he can paper over any cracks</p><p>Tuesday night’s dramatic DfB Pokal defeat at third-tier Saarbrücken was bad news for Bayern Munich. It was even worse news for Borussia Dortmund. Thomas Müller’s Instagram apology to the club’s fans – including for a failure to properly acknowledge those who travelled at the end – felt significant and so it proved.</p><p>This was no real <em>Klassiker</em>. It was no real contest. It was a one-sided rant of a reply, an unloading of frustration and anger, aided and abetted by a BVB who were not even a pale imitation of a challenger. “We made it too easy for them,” lamented their sporting director Sebastian Kehl. It was hard to argue. His team conceded two goals inside the opening eight-and-a-half minutes that should never have been possible. With barely two minutes on the clock Nico Schlotterbeck allowing himself to be given the slip by Dayot Upamecano – amusingly, straight after the grinning former had engaged the latter in chat as they waited for the corner to come in, presumably in an attempt to break his concentration – who headed in. Then the home side left themselves open to a counter-attack – to Bayern of all teams, a gobbler of such opportunities – at the end of which Leroy Sané laid a gift-wrapped chance on for the waiting Harry Kane. In double quick time Dortmund were two down and the evening had reached a premature denouement.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/nov/06/kane-the-instrument-of-vengeance-in-one-sided-rant-against-dortmund"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-06 12:57:22

You could spend days in its screening rooms alone, says our writer</p><p>During the first world war, 124,702 British soldiers were victims of gas attacks. They suffered blisters, burns or temporary blindness and 2,308 of them died. In July 1918, the Ministry of Information sent American society portraitist John Singer Sargent to the front. There he witnessed the aftermath of mustard gas attacks and was inspired to make a six-metre wide tableau called Gassed depicting a procession of wounded men stumbling, blindfolded, towards a dressing station, while in the foreground more men lie dead and dying, their bodies entangled.</p><p>Recently cleaned to reveal a rosy evening light (and even Tommies playing an incongruous football match in the painting’s background), Gassed is the centrepiece of the Imperial War Museum’s new Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries in London. This permanent exhibition features about 500 works tracing the history of war art from July 1916 when Muirhead Bone became the first official artist making etchings in the Somme’s killing fields, to the 21st century and works such as Paul Seawright’s 2002 photograph Mounds, which unwittingly echoes Bone’s work by depicting an Afghan landscape bombed senseless, unpeopled and riddled with mines.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/06/blavatkik-kids-genocide-imperial-war-museums-harrowing-new-galleries"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-06 12:35:35

We were both struggling to entertain our toddlers, and we commiserated awhile. After the children fell asleep, he told me he’d recently left the Mormon church. He said he missed the community and the certainty he once felt. He was still figuring out how to raise a child without faith: for example, would I say there was a heaven if my daughter asked, even if I didn’t fully believe it?</p><p>Maybe it feels more natural to speak intimately with a stranger on a flight, when you are both uprooted and disoriented, not quite sure if it’s night or day or where the sun should hang in the sky. Maybe it’s more natural for your mind to turn to existential questions when you’re hurtling through the atmosphere at great speed, held up by forces you can’t fully understand. For a few hours we talked about fear and loss, and I later thought that while this kind of intensity is discouraged, maybe such subjects are actually best explored with someone completely unfamiliar to you, who sees the world quite differently.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/06/the-big-idea-why-we-should-spend-more-time-talking-to-strangers"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-06 12:30:37

Why I’m campaigning for the £1 cuppa to be available all around Britain | Luke Turner,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/06/tea-prices-museum-cafe-britain-biscuits-high-street-chains,"<p>I’ve done a tea-and-biscuit survey of the country’s cultural institutions and high-street chains – and I’m afraid we’re being taken for mugs</p><p>It’s odd to be mocked by baked goods, but that’s exactly what happened recently when I took a break from working in the reading rooms at the British Library for an afternoon pick-me-up of sugar and caffeine. There, peering up from the counter of the library cafe, was a beige doubledecker biscuit with marzipan teeth and goggly eyes called a “monster cookie – raawrr”. It was priced at £5.95. A simple cup of tea to go with the snack cost £2.25, meaning that for both, you’d be pushing a tenner. That grinning biscuit was taking the piss.</p><p>These extortionate prices are not unique to the British Library. I took my toddler to the National Maritime Museum, and ended up spending £7.80 on tea and a bit of cake to take the edge off being up since 6am. Cakes are luxuries we can do without, but the prices of hot drinks in our leading cultural institutions seem particularly outrageous, having rocketed up (like everything else) in the past year or so. The British Library even looks reasonable compared with most, and it’s not just a London thing, either – the Museum of Liverpool charges £2.60 for a tea; it’s £2.50 at the Imperial War Museum North, and at the National Museum of Scotland, £2.70.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/06/tea-prices-museum-cafe-britain-biscuits-high-street-chains"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-06 12:00:37

And guess whose bed she used to poo on</p><p>I think the tone was set when Ella threw up over me on the way back from the Dogs Trust. She was three months old, rolling around on the back seat between me and my twin brother, Michael (we’d just turned seven), and wasn’t enjoying her first trip in a car. She could have been sick anywhere – over the seat, over the floor – but for some reason she decided to climb on to me first.</p><p>It was the start of a beautiful but strangely one-sided friendship. Ella, a ridgeback-staffie cross, was the perfect dog: playful, energetic, naughty and tolerant. She would let us poke and prod her without complaint, turn her ears inside-out or dress her up in T-shirts or the thick woollen poncho my Greek Cypriot grandma knitted her for the British winter.

This is how a folktale from Piedmont, told by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/italocalvino"">Italo Calvino</a>, begins. There was rivalry, so the king decided to sort out their inheritance with three stones. One after the other, the kids would use a slingshot to send their stone as far as they possibly could. Where the stone fell, they would find a partner.</p><p>The first stone, of the eldest son, landed on the roof of a bakery, and the second on the house of a weaver, while the stone of the youngest’s landed in a ditch. Each grabbing a ring, the three boys charged off to meet their match.

Love Actually at 20: Richard Curtis’s imperfect yet irresistible Christmas romcom,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/06/love-actually-richard-curtis-hugh-grant,"<p>Far from unimpeachable, with problems ranging from a lack of diversity to an overdose of saccharine, the festive ensemble comedy is an annual staple nonetheless</p><p>Of the many gestures of love, small and, more frequently, supersized, in Love Actually, the one that always stood out to me is of the former kind. Hugh Grant’s prime minister sits in a grand yet cosy drawing room at No 10, alone on Christmas Eve, rifling through holiday cards in his red despatch box. He comes across one from Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), the tea lady he’s been pining for since their first, expletive-filled meeting. “If you can’t say it at Christmas, when can you, eh?” she writes. “I’m actually yours.”</p><p>This statement of devotion, lovely in its smallness, precipitates Grant’s more memorable response, knocking on every door on her street in “the dodgy end” of Wandsworth until he finds her.

Showdown at the Grand review – zombie-mashing Dolph Lundgren in ode to 80s action flicks,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/06/showdown-at-the-grand-review-zombie-mashing-dolph-lundgren-in-ode-to-80s-action-flicks,"<p>Terrence Howard is terrific as a cinema owner who hires his ageing movie idol to help him battle corporate goons</p><p>‘There are a lot of things to dislike in this world. Nazis. Modern art. Vegans. But above all I despise vampires.” That’s Dolph Lundgren in a growl, wearing a ludicrous wig, and karate-kicking his way through a horde of undead. Lundgren plays ageing action star Claude Luc Hallyday, a veteran of trashy films with trashier titles (Moses v the Nazis!). It’s a supporting role but Lundgren is the main attraction in Orson Oblowitz’s misty-eyed, sentimental, sometimes silly love letter to cinema. The setting is a gorgeous movie palace where the owner has a thing for tough guy Hallyday, watching his 80s action flicks on repeat – funny pastiche clips shot here as little movies-in-a-movie.</p><p>To be fair, Terrence Howard is also pretty terrific as cinema proprietor George, whose family have owned the Grand since it opened in the 1920s. George grew up in the cinema, and Howard plays him as a man who’s never fully signed up to the outside world, dressed like a cowboy in a long leather duster coat, and speaking in a faintly grandiose way like a character from a classic movie. His problems begin when a corporate developer Lynn (Amanda Righetti) sets her sights on his cinema, planning to bulldoze it to make way for gleaming luxury apartments.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/06/showdown-at-the-grand-review-zombie-mashing-dolph-lundgren-in-ode-to-80s-action-flicks"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-06 10:30:34

Sensing that he might be made the scapegoat for Switzerland’s embarrassment, he has a new plan to prove his enduring patriotism by being as sycophantic to the Americans as he was to the Germans.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/06/a-forgotten-man-review-watchable-account-of-central-figure-in-swiss-wartime-guilt"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-06 09:00:32

Officially unveiled this summer by the first lady, Olena Zelenska, the bronze assemblage depicts a young boy and girl in the guise of angels, apparently embarking on a winged ascent to heaven. To my taste, it is a triumph of kitsch, whose sentimentality is out of step with the profound tragedies it commemorates. Still, when I visited, little offerings of toys had been left at the statue’s base: evidence that many people disagreed, and found it a useful focus of contemplation.</p><p>Ukraine’s landscape of memory is in a state of flux.

Over the past century, the author of Eugene Onegin has been so thoroughly appropriated as a metonym for the <em>Russkiy mir</em>, or Russian political and cultural space, and so consistently instrumentalised as a marker of Russian power and influence, that he has fallen foul of new Ukrainian decolonisation laws. Pushkin Park in Kyiv, for instance, is now Ivan Bahrianyi Park, named after the 20th-century Ukrainian novelist and dissident.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/06/memorialise-horrors-of-war-in-ukraine-artists-engineers"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-06 07:00:32

‘We all knew what we were getting into!’ Gross-out lesbian comedy Bottoms and its audacious director,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/06/we-all-knew-what-we-were-getting-into-gross-out-lesbian-comedy-bottoms-and-its-unrepentant-director,"<p>Emma Seligman reveals how she made this outrageous romp about schoolgirls setting up a fight club in order to bed cheerleaders – and explains why a ‘really gay’ Marvel movie might be next</p><p>Bottoms is a high school movie stuffed with all the great high school movie tropes. There are nerds and jocks, slow clappings, grand gestures on the football field, graffitied lockers and a sad montage that unfolds to the sound of Avril Lavigne’s Complicated. But its leads are PJ and Josie, the “ugly, untalented gays” who set up an after-school fight club with the sole aim of having sex with the cheerleaders. Girls punch each other in the face, teachers read porn magazines in class, everyone pretends to be “empowered” – and, somehow, it still manages to be a feelgood delight. Thrillingly, it may be the least earnest film I have seen in years.</p><p>Its director, 28-year-old Emma Seligman, is in London, explaining how a comedy about amoral, horny teen lesbians gets made. Not easily, and not quickly, it turns out. She and her co-writer Rachel Sennott – who plays PJ and who also starred in Seligman’s debut, Shiva Baby – started working on the idea six years ago. It was rejected by “every studio bar one that was semi-interested”, until Orion Pictures finally gave it the go-ahead. “We were certainly aware that we were not making something that was incredibly palatable, but Orion just got it,” Seligman says. “I felt pretty encouraged to just go for it. If you signed on to do this movie – whether you were financing it, or you were one of the actors, or you were doing the sound edit – you knew what you were getting in to.”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/06/we-all-knew-what-we-were-getting-into-gross-out-lesbian-comedy-bottoms-and-its-unrepentant-director"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-06 05:00:28

Local media reported 20 deaths – figures that could not be independently verified.</p><p><strong>“This is a tragedy that could have been avoided,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said of the soldiers’ deaths.</strong> “A criminal investigation has been registered into the tragedy. The main thing is to establish the full truth about what happened and to prevent this from happening again.”</p><p><strong>Ukrainian cruise missiles damaged a warship docked at the occupied Crimean peninsula</strong>, Russia admitted on Sunday, a day after Ukraine announced the strike. Ukraine launched 15 cruise missiles at the BE Butoma shipyard based in the east coast city of Kerch on Saturday, with air defences shooting down 13, Russia’s defence ministry said. Ukrainian attacks have progressively been making Crimea untenable for Russia’s Black Sea fleet to use. Ukraine said the damaged warship was one of Russia’s most advanced, able to fire Kalibr cruise missiles. Online observers named the ship as the Askold.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy said the cost of letting Russia win the war would be further conflict involving ground troops from Nato countries</strong>, as he urged US lawmakers on NBC’s Meet the Press to increase war funding. Zelenskiy also said he was “not ready” for talks with Russia unless its invading troops withdraw. The United States “know I am not ready to speak with the terrorists, because their word is nothing”, he said. “They have to go out from our territory, only after that the world can switch on diplomacy.”</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy also urged Donald Trump to visit Ukraine</strong>, where he said it would take minutes to show the war-sceptic former US president his errors about the conflict.</p><p><strong>Tensions simmered between the civilian and military wings of Ukraine’s leadership</strong> as the president’s office publicly rebuked top military commander Valerii Zaluzhnyi for his comments that the war was at a stalemate.

Should I worry about my salt intake?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/05/should-i-worry-about-my-salt-intake,"<p>Salt, AKA sodium chloride, has been used to preserve food and enhance flavours for thousands of years. Can it really be a health hazard?</p><p>“The cure for anything is salt,” says a character in Karen Blixen’s short story The Deluge at Norderney. “Sweat, tears, or the sea.” But while there’s a lot to commend a long run, a little cry or a pensive look at the wide blue ocean, everyday life has got a lot saltier since Blixen’s era – and salt is no longer the cure-all it once was. So what should we be doing about it?</p><p>First things first: the World Health Organization recommends capping your salt intake at 5g a day, and keeping it even lower if possible. That’s because, according to a <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4567"">large body</a> <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/9/1970"">of evidence</a>, ingesting a lot of it<strong> </strong>is linked to high blood pressure, which in turn is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. (Salt is technically sodium chloride; it’s the sodium that seems to lead to most of its ill-effects, which is why American brands tend to tout their reduced-sodium options.)</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/05/should-i-worry-about-my-salt-intake"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-05 15:00:11

You just have to know the right formula<p>Navigating your way through life can often feel like playing a complex board game. Every scenario you encounter has a set of rules that represents some sort of obstacle to you arriving at your destination. Indeed, it has been suggested that the human species started playing games as a safe space for experimenting with the best way to plan a strategy to get to our goals in life.</p><p>As soon as we began to realise that the universe was governed by rules, we started to create games to explore those rules. Many animals play games when they are young, but our species is probably unique in continuing to play games into adulthood.

He agreed, and stayed true to his word, despite being definitely wrong.</p><p>When you find that you’re seriously ill, you know a lot of things are going to change, and it’s scary.

She talks about being a guardian of Iceland’s wilderness and how young people will make real change</p><p>It is hard to think of anyone as symbolic of their nation as Björk. The singer has lived away from Iceland over the years – in London and New York, and is often on tour – but when she’s been away she has always felt, she says, like she is “holding her breath”, both in anticipation of return and in memory of purer air. In recent years, since her relationship with the artist <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/matthew-barney"">Matthew Barney</a> ended in 2013, she has lived pretty much full-time near Reykjavik, where she has witnessed the great surge in tourism to the island, which has risen from a few hundred thousand annual visitors 20 years ago to almost 2 million now.</p><p>You couldn’t quantify exactly what proportion of that interest in volcano and glacier is down to Björk’s own one-woman nation branding, but there is no doubt that her wild and whirling music, with its operatic cutting edges of trance and techno, has done much to establish the unique cool of her native island in the eco-traveller’s mind. It is for this reason that when she adds her trippy voice to any environmental campaign, it has ripples well beyond the north Atlantic.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/05/bjork-rosalia-single-iceland-environment-salmon-fish-farming-interview"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-05 12:00:07

That day in Turin, an Argentinian student who would briefly embark on a career as a diplomat was handed what he describes as his life’s mission to become a kind of footballing archaeologist, travelling the world to recover its most treasured relics; the “armour” with which its idols fought. Thirty-three years later, the result is the most significant collection of football shirts on earth, at last displayed in a Madrid museum.</p><p>He met everyone: Pelé, Maradona, Steve Hodge but in the beginning there was Claudio Caniggia. Ordás was 17 and was at the 1990 World Cup second-round clash between international football’s greatest rivals, a tale told of a suffering steadily building to the moment that changed his life: from Brazil tearing Argentina apart and their fans taunting him from the other side of the fence – “our pain was their entertainment” – to the realisation he could watch no more, sitting head in hands “waiting for them to score so we could all go home”. And the noise that made him look again.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/05/footballs-memory-keeper-the-man-with-more-than-5000-shirts"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-05 08:00:03
How to Have Sex review – two stars are born with this searing study of consent,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/05/how-to-have-sex-review-two-stars-are-born-in-a-searing-study-of-consent-molly-manning-walker-mia-mckenna-bruce,"<p>First-time British director Molly Manning Walker’s remarkable drama about a group of post-GCSE girls hellbent on partying in Crete features a career-making performance from new talent Mia McKenna-Bruce</p><p>Here’s a cause for celebration for fans of British cinema: a feature debut that launches not one but two of the most promising talents to arrive in movie theatres for a long while. Writer and director <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/08/molly-manning-walker-how-to-have-sex-interview-cannes-london-film-festival"">Molly Manning Walker</a> is the complete package: a storyteller with an acute ear for youth vernacular; a film-maker with a gift for capturing images that sear themselves into your eyes, while also filling each frame with a sensory overload of energy and movement; and a director who can tease remarkably intimate and revealing moments from actors while simultaneously marshalling a club full of several hundred hard-partying extras. And the film’s star, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/27/how-to-have-sex-film-mia-mckenna-bruce-cannes-interview"">Mia McKenna-Bruce</a>, is a revelation. You have to go back to Florence Pugh’s breakout role in <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/30/lady-macbeth-review-florence-pugh-william-oldroyd"">Lady Macbeth</a></em> to find another career-making performance that so emphatically announces an actor destined for greatness.</p><p><em>How to Have Sex</em>, which won the Un Certain Regard award at Cannes in May, takes one of the central themes of innumerable 1990s and 00s teen comedies – the desperate quest to lose your virginity (and preferably party to oblivion at the same time) – and peels back the riotous excess and hedonism to uncover some uncomfortable questions about the grey areas of consent and the coercive influence of peers. Walker’s handling of the film’s tonal range is remarkably assured: the picture is skittish, spirited and very funny, and at the same time troubling and bruisingly sad.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/05/how-to-have-sex-review-two-stars-are-born-in-a-searing-study-of-consent-molly-manning-walker-mia-mckenna-bruce"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-05 08:00:02
The big picture: Dennis Morris’s 70s London,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/05/the-big-picture-dennis-morris-70s-london,"<p>The photographer was just 15 and already a professional when he shot this cool young boy in the East End</p><p>The British photographer <a href=""https://www.dennismorris.com/index.html"">Dennis Morris</a> took this picture in the East End of London in 1975, when he was just 15 years old. At that time Morris would spend most of his afternoons wandering the local neighbourhood, looking for subjects, inspired by his street-photographer heroes, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/henricartierbresson"">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/don-mccullin"">Don McCullin</a>. He spotted the boy in sunglasses standing beside graffiti for the local reggae band Black Slate (who later had chart success with the Rastafarian anthem, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9NgIPLtwSc"">Amigo</a>). “I just came across this kid, looking super-cool,” he recalls, “his stance was cool, too, and he knew it.” The picture is included in an exhibition from Morris’s unique 1970s archive, <a href=""https://la-fab.com/en/la_galerie/dennis-morris-colored-black/"">Colored Black</a>, that opened in Paris last week.</p><p>Morris had become obsessed with photography from the age of nine. He had been part of a church choir in Hackney that was sponsored by Donald Paterson, a manufacturer and inventor of photographic equipment, and some of the boys also got involved in a photographic club that Paterson created. Morris remembers the afternoon that he first watched an image develop in the club’s dark room – “magic!” – and saw his vocation appear before his eyes. He first funded his practice by taking pictures of local families’ kids and weddings. “I was good and very cheap,” he says, “[but] my family were not supportive one little bit. I came from a lower than working-class West Indian family and the idea was you went to work as soon as you left school.”</p><p><a href=""https://la-fab.com/en/la_galerie/dennis-morris-colored-black/"">Dennis Morris: Colored Black is at the Galerie du Jour – Agnès B, Paris until 15 January</a></p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/05/the-big-picture-dennis-morris-70s-london"">Continue reading...</a>",2023-11-05 07:00:02

But it does mean designers from Stella McCartney to Andreas Kronthaler at Vivienne Westwood have turned their attention away from flowers towards abstract prints – think a Frankenthaler or Richter in dress form.</p><p>This means the high street is flooded with frocks that are really useful pieces to have in your wardrobe. An abstract print works for a wide range of invitations, from weddings to dinners, or any event where you want to feel a bit dressed up without making a whole heap of effort.
